<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey. <br />
  …the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa 
  the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
</p>

<p>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

</p>

<p>No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. <br />
   It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! <br />
   You've swallowed a planet! I'm nobody's taxi service; <br />
   I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</p>
